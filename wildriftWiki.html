        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>League of Legends: Wild Rift is a 5v5 MOBA game developed by Riot Games and released it on October 27, 2020 specifically for mobile PvP fights. It is a 5v5 battle arena where players can show their strength and tactical moves. This can be played with friends and family, for this game is filled with action, thrill, and new features that other similar games don’t have.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Like LoL, Wild Rift has similar gameplay as its sister game. The main difference between the two is the user interface, since Wild Rift is played on mobile. The two teams of five powerful champions have only one goal and that is to break the Nexus on the enemy team. The Nexus is where the player’s allied minions will spawn, and behind of the Nexus is the fountain wherein they can rapidly regenerate ther health and mana, and also to access the Shop. To reach the opposing Nexus, the team must clear at least one lane. Turrets and inhibitors are defense structures that defend the base of each opposing teams. Each lane features three turrets and one inhibitor, with two turrets guarding each Nexus. Turrets deliver damage to opposing minions and champions while also providing their team with limited visibility due to the Fog of War. To dodge damage and rush ahead, those structures, alongside the minions, should be attacked to continue the progress. A Turret surrounds each Inhibitor to keep it safe. Super minions will spawn in that lane for several minutes after being destroyed. The Inhibitor will revive after that, and Super Minions will stop spawning. The jungle, which lies between the lanes, is home to neutral beasts and jungle vegetation. The Drakes and Baron Nashor are the two most powerful beasts. Killing these units provides your team with distinct benefits and can even swing the game around.</p>

        </div>
        <p>The optimum squad composition for the game consists of five lanes. Each lane caters to specific champions and roles. Top lane champions are the team's toughest individual fighters. It is their responsibility to defend their lane while concentrating on the opponent team's strongest members. The role of the junglers is to hunt. They sneak between lanes with stealth and skill, keeping a watchful eye on the most crucial neutral monsters and waiting for an opponent to drop their guard. Mid laners are high-burst damage champions who can do it all, both solo and with a team. Combat may not be their specialty, but they will find ways to outdo their enemy. Bot lane champions are the team's dynamite. They must be protected early on as valuable cargo before gathering enough gold and experience to propel the team to victory. Support champions are team guardians. They help keep teammates alive and primarily focus on setting up kills, protecting their teammate in bot lane until they become stronger.</p>

        <p>Sample gameplay of League of Legends</p>
        </div><p>As the game proceeds, Champions gain experience and wealth to level up and purchase more powerful things. Overpowering the opponent team and destroying their base requires staying on top of these two aspects. Champions level up as they gain experience, unlocking or strengthening skills and increasing their base stats. Kill enemy units and champions, assist in a kill, and destroy defense buildings to get experience. The in-game money used to purchase equipment for your champion is gold. Kill enemy units and champions, aid in a kill, destroy defense structures, and equip gold income equipment to earn gold. The Shop is where you may use your gold to buy and sell stuff. It's only available if you're at the Fountain. Champions can have up to seven items and five core skills at once. Choosing the right ability order, summoner spells, and item composition for your champion will aid your team's success.</p>

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Game's Design Director is named Zilean.</strong> Tom "Zileas" Cadwell, a creative director at Riot Games, inspired Zilean, the legendary Chronokeeper. Cadwell has an outstanding resume, including a computer science degree from MIT and work on Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne and World of Warcraft at Blizzard.</li>
            <li><strong>A 14th-Century Italian Knight is mentioned in the game.</strong> The famous Italian fencing master Fiore dei Liberi had a large influence on martial arts, due mainly to his illuminated manuscripts which have survived for over 600 years. In League of Legends, the character Fiora uses fencing as her fighting style and she has a very similar name.</li>
            <li><strong>Tristana's Buster Shot is a Mega Man tribute.</strong> Another blue action hero with a buster shot you might be familiar with. The likeness is uncanny.</li>
            <li><strong>After you've won the Howling Abyss, stay for a fun bonus.</strong> After you've won the Howling Abyss, wait about half a minute for Lissandra, the Ice Witch, to give you some fascinating narration in her frigid aristocratic accent. It was the greatest of times and the worst of times all at the same time. It was the three sisters' time...</li>
            <li><strong>Nidalee looks a lot like Nävis from the French comic book "Wake."</strong> The bestial huntress Nidalee could be based on Nävis from the illustrated series Wake, however Riot hasn't acknowledged this. Nävis is a jungle dweller who happens to be accompanied by a cougar-like friend.</li>
            <li><strong>The Original Champion is Singed.</strong> Singed, the crazy chemist, holds the distinction of becoming the game's first figurehead for Champions. He was one of the original Champions created, with Annie, Sion, and Sivir.</li>
            <li><strong>League of Legends is the second most lucrative eSport.</strong> With approximately $20 million in prize money paid since the game's release, League of Legends is the second most profitable competitive game in eSports history. That's more than Counter-Strike and StarCraft put together!</li>
            <li><strong>Characters from the Lord of the Rings inspired Aatrox.</strong> Mike Laygo, a senior animator on League of Legends, stated that Aatrox’s animations were inspired by Balrog and Sauron. Lago himself has previously worked on Lord of the Rings games.
</li>
            <li><strong>A Poro can be made to grow a black moustache</strong>Poros are loved by all, and they're even cuter with a massive black moustache. Simply feed it Poro-Snax while playing as Braum, and it will grow facial hair to match its burly benefactor.</li>
            <li><strong>The voices of Zyra, Cassiopeia, Fiora, Shyvan, and Elise are the same.</strong>Karen Strassman is the voice actress behind these five characters. She's worked on legendary anime like Gurren Lagann, Samurai Champloo, and Code Geass, so you might recognize her.</li>
