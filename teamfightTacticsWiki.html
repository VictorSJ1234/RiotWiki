        </div>
        <p>Team fight tactics is a round-based autobattler where players draft a unique team of champions to fight for first place. To win, you must be the last person standing but victory requires a solid strategy. Build your team into unstoppable force over the course of the game by pocketing gold and experience points at the end of each battle. The higher your experience level, the more champions you can place on the battlefield. You can also grab a freebie from a shared pool every few rounds. Pay attention to the champions origins and classes. There are hundreds of combinations and matchups. Placing champions from the same origin or class will grant special effects to your team. Find the best synergies to outlast your enemies. Build and combine items to help your champions gain an advantage. Every item buffs a specific stat, combining it with a second item will unlock a unique a passive. Items will drop at random during the rounds against monters. You can also find them attached to champions during the carousel rounds. </p>
