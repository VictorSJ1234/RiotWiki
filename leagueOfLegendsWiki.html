        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>League of Legends or also known as League is a free to play Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) and team-oriented strategy game, it is founded by Brandon Beck and Marc Merrill in 2006 with a clear vision of supporting or prioritizing players experience. League climbs the largest e-sports community in the world and supported by hundreds and millions of fans to watch annually as their best-loved professional teams and players compete for Championships, with salaried pro gamers produce at the very best ranges of opposition with hundreds of thousands of dollars at the line.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The two teams of five powerful champions have only one goal and that is to break the Nexus on the enemy team. The Nexus is where the player’s allied minions will spawn and behind of the Nexus is the fountain wherein player can rapidly regenerate his health and mana, also can access the Shop. To reach the opposing Nexus, the team must clear at least one lane. Turrets and inhibitors are defense structures that block the enemies’ progress. Each lane features three turrets and one inhibitor, with two turrets guarding each Nexus. Turrets deliver damage to opposing minions and champions while also providing their team with limited visibility due to the Fog of War. To dodge damage and rush ahead, the players should attack these structures with minions in front of you. A Turret surrounds each Inhibitor to keep it safe. Super minions will spawn in that lane for several minutes after being destroyed. The Inhibitor will revive after that, and Super Minions will stop spawning. The jungle, which lies between the lanes, is home to neutral beasts and jungle vegetation. The Drakes and Baron Nashor are the two most powerful beasts. Killing these units provides your team with distinct benefits and can even swing the game around.</p>
        <div class ="gameplayDivCon">

        </div>
        <p>The optimum squad composition for the game consists of five lanes. Each lane caters to specific champions and roles; try them all or stick to the one that speaks to you. Top lane champions are the team's toughest individual fighters. It is their responsibility to defend their lane while concentrating on the opponent team's strongest members. Junglers exist to hunt. They sneak between lanes with stealth and skill, keeping a watchful eye on the most crucial neutral monsters and waiting for an opponent to drop their guard. Mid laners are high-burst damage champions who can do it all, both solo and with a team. Combat is a perilous dance for them, and they're always looking for methods to outplay their opponents. Bot lane champions are the team's dynamite. They must be protected early on as valuable cargo before gathering enough gold and experience to propel the team to victory. Support champions are team guardians. They help keep teammates alive and primarily focus on setting up kills, protecting their teammate in bot lane until they become stronger.</p>
        <p>The creators want to release a new agent approximately once each act. New agents take 12–15 months to build, and their design is centered on issues such as what's lacking from the game's existing playstyles, whether there are any potential thematics that provide significant opportunities, and what's required for greater game health.</p>

        </div>
        <p>As the game proceeds, Champions gain experience and wealth to level up and purchase more powerful things. Overpowering the opponent team and destroying their base requires staying on top of these two aspects. Champions level up as they gain experience, unlocking or strengthening skills and increasing their base stats. Kill enemy units and champions, assist in a kill, and destroy defense buildings to get experience. The in-game money used to purchase equipment for your champion is gold. Kill enemy units and champions, aid in a kill, destroy defense structures, and equip gold income equipment to earn gold. The Shop is where you may use your gold to buy and sell stuff. It's only available at the Fountain. Champions can have up to seven items and five core skills at once. Choosing the right ability order, summoner spells, and item composition for your champion will aid the team's success.</p>

        <h2>Cosmetics</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>There are now 235 Chroma skins in League of Legends. Chroma skins are simply distinct skin modifications that can improve and differentiate the skin. There are around 2750 Chroma Skins in League of Legends right now.</p>
        <p>Riot Games has also improved their Chroma game in the last six months. They frequently add nearly as many chromas to these skins as they do to conventional skins. When most new 1350 RP skins are introduced, they now include Chroma options as well.</p>
        <p>Chromas are not included in the overall number of skins in League of Legends since, while they are distinctive, they are merely a duplicate of another skin that cannot be used without it. Chroma skins can be purchased after purchasing a specific skin and can only be utilized when that skin is equipped.</p>
        <p>There are seven different price categories for store skins:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>390 RP</li>
            <li>520 RP</li>
            <li>750 RP</li>
            <li>975 RP</li>
            <li>1350 RP (Epic Skin)</li>
            <li>1820 RP (Legendary Skin)</li>
            <li>3250 RP (Ultimate Skin)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Legendary and Ultimate skins are the most advanced, with a variety of visual and auditory elements. However, there are just a few Legendary skins and a few Ultimate skins. There are 26 skins that are no longer available for purchase, 55 rare skins, and 309 Legacy skins.</p>
        <p>Prestige Skins, on the other hand, may only be obtained through in-game events. These skins cannot be purchased with RP and must be unlocked using Prestige Points or Event Points obtained through Event passes. Orange Essence or Riot Points will not unlock Prestige Skins (RP).</p>
        <p>Promotional skins are the final category. They can only be obtained by participating in certain promotions, such as obtaining Riot Girl Tristana through their Facebook promotion.</p>
        <p>The amount of skins in each category is as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>390 RP - 3 skins</li>
            <li>520 RP - 161 skins</li>
            <li>750 RP - 129 skins</li>
            <li>975 RP - 333 skins</li>
            <li>1350 RP - 377 skins</li>
            <li>1820 RP - 61 skins</li>

        <h2>Characters</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>The player can choose for over 140 champions that is fit to his desired role. The game has six different categories for champions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Assassin - Move rapidly while dealing massive damage to a single target. Quick fighting and jumping to safety are the finest uses for these heroes.</li>
            <li>Fighter - These champions have a lot of damage dealing and taking abilities. Fighters excel in long-duration battles.</li>
            <li>Mages - These champions excel in long-distance battles. Mages may do a lot of damage while remaining invulnerable to attacks if they are sufficiently protected.</li>
            <li>Marksmen - Like mages, Marksmen are best used while doing damage at a distance.</li>
            <li>Support - The primary function of support characters is to magnify the strengths and abilities of their teammates.</li>
            <li>Tank – Just like fighters, Tanks are best deployed as a "damage sponge."</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Due to the numerous playable champions in the game, one character per category is presented as an example on how these roles are played.</p>

            <p>Bard, a visitor from beyond the stars, is a serendipitous agent who strives to establish a balance in which life can withstand chaos' indifference. Many Runeterrans write songs about his remarkable nature, but they all agree that the cosmic wanderer is lured to powerful magical treasures.

        <h2>Trivia</h2>
        <hr>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The Game's Design Director is named Zilean.</strong> Tom "Zileas" Cadwell, a creative director at Riot Games, inspired Zilean, the legendary Chronokeeper. Cadwell has an outstanding resume, including a computer science degree from MIT and work on Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne and World of Warcraft at Blizzard.</li>
            <li><strong>A 14th-Century Italian Knight is mentioned in the game.</strong> The famous Italian fencing master Fiore dei Liberi had a large influence on martial arts, due mainly to his illuminated manuscripts which have survived for over 600 years. In League of Legends, the character Fiora uses fencing as her fighting style and she has a very similar name.</li>
            <li><strong>Tristana's Buster Shot is a Mega Man tribute.</strong> Another blue action hero with a buster shot you might be familiar with. The likeness is uncanny.</li>
            <li><strong>After you've won the Howling Abyss, stay for a fun bonus.</strong> After you've won the Howling Abyss, wait about half a minute for Lissandra, the Ice Witch, to give you some fascinating narration in her frigid aristocratic accent. It was the greatest of times and the worst of times all at the same time. It was the three sisters' time...</li>
            <li><strong>Nidalee looks a lot like Nävis from the French comic book "Wake."</strong> The bestial huntress Nidalee could be based on Nävis from the illustrated series Wake, however Riot hasn't acknowledged this. Nävis is a jungle dweller who happens to be accompanied by a cougar-like friend.</li>
            <li><strong>The Original Champion is Singed.</strong> Singed, the crazy chemist, holds the distinction of becoming the game's first figurehead for Champions. He was one of the original Champions created, with Annie, Sion, and Sivir.</li>
            <li><strong>League of Legends is the second most lucrative eSport.</strong> With approximately $20 million in prize money paid since the game's release, League of Legends is the second most profitable competitive game in eSports history. That's more than Counter-Strike and StarCraft put together!</li>
            <li><strong>Characters from the Lord of the Rings inspired Aatrox.</strong> Mike Laygo, a senior animator on League of Legends, stated that Aatrox’s animations were inspired by Balrog and Sauron. Lago himself has previously worked on Lord of the Rings games.
</li>
            <li><strong>A Poro can be made to grow a black moustache</strong>Poros are loved by all, and they're even cuter with a massive black moustache. Simply feed it Poro-Snax while playing as Braum, and it will grow facial hair to match its burly benefactor.</li>
            <li><strong>The voices of Zyra, Cassiopeia, Fiora, Shyvan, and Elise are the same.</strong>Karen Strassman is the voice actress behind these five characters. She's worked on legendary anime like Gurren Lagann, Samurai Champloo, and Code Geass, so you might recognize her.</li>
