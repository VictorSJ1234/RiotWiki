        <!--Brief Description-->
        <p>Valorant is a 5v5 character-based tactical shooter, developed by Riot Games. This game is available worldwide.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Synopsis</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Valorant is a 5v5 character-based tactical shooter, developed by Riot Games. This game is available worldwide. Players take on the role of one of a variety of Agents, characters based on many countries and cultures from across the world. Each round, each player begins with a classic handgun and one or more signature ability charges. Other weapons and ability charges may be acquired through an in-game economy that awards money based on the previous round's results.</p>
        <br>

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>Agents have one Signature Ability that they can use each round for free.</p>
        <p>Riot intended for the game to start with 12 agents, however only 8 were accessible in the early press versions. Breach was launched in a private event on March 29, 2020. Raze was added along with the map Split since the Closed Beta debut on April 7, 2020, increasing the Agent total to ten. Five agents are accessible at the start of the game, with two more readily obtained by leveling up. More agents may be unlocked by accepting Contracts and gaining XP.</p>
        <p>Agents have a starting health of 100; Light Shields increase this to 125, while Heavy Shields increase it to 150.</p>
        <p>The creators want to release a new agent approximately once each act. New agents take 12â€“15 months to build, and their design is centered on issues such as what's lacking from the game's existing playstyles, whether there are any potential thematics that provide significant opportunities, and what's required for greater game health.</p>
        <p>Each agent is assigned to one of four roles based on their strengths and playstyle:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Controller agents are masters in cutting risky area in order to put their team up for victory.</li>
            <li>Duelist agents are self-sufficient fraggers that their squad expects to score high frags and seek out engagements first due to their talents and capabilities.</li>
            <li>Initiator agents test angles by positioning their team to approach contested territory and force defenders away.</li>
            <li>Sentinel agents are defensive specialists that can seal down regions and keep an eye on flanks on both attacker and defense rounds.</li>
            <br>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Storyline</h2>
